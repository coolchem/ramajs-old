RamaJS Component Framework
====

RamaJS is Javascript Component development framework. It was designed focus on the View in MVC and helps creating custom views, manage and extend them easily.
I started working on this framework with an intention to create a component framework designed to build large scale Responsive web applications.
The focus of this framework is on customization and reusability of views, which is achieved through concept of Skinning.
The framework work is still in progress and I will be pretty soon looking for contributors to help build on it.
